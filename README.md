# Fantasy Bundesliga

I enjoy playing [Fantasy Bundesliga](https://fantasy.bundesliga.com/). 
However, I don't have the time, nor the motivation to keep myself up to date
on whatever is happening in today's soccer world. 

The basic idea is to use linear optimization to find the line up that 
maximizes the team's points.

As there isn't an official API that you can use to download the game's data, 
I've built a scraper that fetches the official data straight from the 
Bundesliga website.
